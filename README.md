An project done for Hack&Roll 2022 hackathon over 24 hours.

## Inspiration
Some not-so-polite cat memes and our slack spirit.

## What it does
A productive application for Android that can help people focus on tasks. An annoying cat resides in the application. 
Once you have promised to “spare” a period of time with it, you should not use your phone or the cat will annoy you in various ways.

To be specific, these will happen when you start the timer and exit the app:
- an annoying cat pops up and loiters around over your screen. It will not affect you using other apps, but it is annoying
- the cat spams you with notifications urging you to not to use your phone

## Tech stack
Natively built with Android Studio and Java.
