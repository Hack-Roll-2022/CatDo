## Inspiration
Some not-so-polite cat memes and our slack spirit.

## What it does
A productive application for Android that can help people focus on tasks. An annoying cat resides in the application. Once you have promised to “spare” a period of time with it, you should not use your phone or the cat will annoy you in various ways.

## How I built it
Natively built with Android Studio and Java.

## Challenges we ran into
Foreground and background detection and management. Dealing with XMLs.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finish building the app and it works as intended.

## What I learned
Team cooperations and communications.

## What's next for CatDo
Google Play Store
